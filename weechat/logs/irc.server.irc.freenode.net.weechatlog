2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- exposed.
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	-
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- other service.
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	-
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	-
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your
2015-03-13 10:48:44	--	- passwords again after analysis has completed.
